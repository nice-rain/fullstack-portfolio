## Projects

Currently, our projects are hosted in the nicera.in repository. This is due to web consolidation, as I try to get rid of having to maintain two different portfolios.
As of right now, you must manually build the projects and copy/commit them into this repository. Ideally, we would like to run that as part of the build cycle.
I still feel, personally, that the entire website should be a single react application, but I don't have the time or energy to redo the entire application.
