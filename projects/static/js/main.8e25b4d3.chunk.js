I envisioned a world \n            that someone could walk around in and interact with things such as my work history, education, artwork, and programming skills. \n            During the development of the project, I ran into an issue - the player was unable to move around. I solved this by plugging a \n            Playstation 3 controller into an android phone and using it to control the player's movement. While it still doesn't remove the \n            urge to walk around, I felt that this solution was much better than developing my portfolio as a theme park ride.</p>\n            <h3>Features</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Two VR Maps showcasing my resume as well as my portfolio</li>\n                <li>Employment history timeline</li>\n                <li>Photo-slideshow containing transcript and degrees</li>\n                <li>Art gallery containing artwork I built for several projects.</li>\n                <li>Stable 60fps at all times.</li>\n            </ul>"},projectHeader:{headerFull:"/images/projects/vr_head.jpg",headerMobile:"/images/projects/vr_head.jpg",logo:"/images/projects/vr_logo.png",alt:"VR Portfolio Header",video:"",buttonTitle:"Download Now",buttonAnchor:"#project-downloads"},projectBackgroundImage:"/images/projects/vr_blur.jpg",projectDownloads:[{icon:"fab fa-android",title:"VR Portfolio v1.0 APK",link:"#"}],projectGallery:[{src:"/images/projects/vr/1.png",thumbnail:"/images/projects/vr/1_tn.jpg",thumbnailWidth:320,thumbnailHeight:180,caption:"VR 2.0 Cavern"},{src:"/images/projects/vr/2.png",thumbnail:"/images/projects/vr/2_tn.jpg",thumbnailWidth:320,thumbnailHeight:180,caption:"Work History Timeline"},{src:"/images/projects/vr/3.png",thumbnail:"/images/projects/vr/3_tn.jpg",thumbnailWidth:320,thumbnailHeight:180,caption:"VR Portfolio landing area"},{src:"/images/projects/vr/4.png",thumbnail:"/images/projects/vr/4_tn.jpg",thumbnailWidth:320,thumbnailHeight:180,caption:"Image gallery of older websites I built"},{src:"/images/projects/vr/5.png",thumbnail:"/images/projects/vr/5_tn.jpg",thumbnailWidth:320,thumbnailHeight:180,caption:"Another photo of VR 2.0 cavern"},{src:"/images/projects/vr/6.png",thumbnail:"/images/projects/vr/6_tn.jpg",thumbnailWidth:320,thumbnailHeight:180,caption:"Teleporter into art gallery"}]},mazeescape:{projectTitle:"Maze Escape",projectInfo:{__html:'<h2 id="About">About</h2><p>Maze Escape was a fun project inspired by moves such as The Maze Runner. The premise was a multiplayer, procedural maze that\n            the players needed to escape from. The maze would be filled with enemies and traps as well as puzzles. I also wanted the ability for the maze to change at certain intervals. \n            Because of these requirements, I developed a procedural system that generates a maze within a given boundary. The exit is traced first before applying recursion to place the \n            remaining maze tiles. The script allows for any type of tiles to be placed, including ones with different shapes or textures applied to them. My goal was to have quite a bit \n            of variety throughout the maze.</p>\n            <h3>Current Development State</h3>\n            <p>Unfortunately, the game itself wasn\'t very fun to play (at least in single player). In the movie, the maze was designed to be torture, and I feel that this project accomplishes \n            the same thing. Running around trying to escape with 1 life is not very enjoyable. With a large maze, it could potentially take over an hour for the user to escape in a single-player \n            game. There are quite a few things that I\'d add in order to make the game more enjoyable if I ever resumed this project.</p><p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently I have lost the latest \n            build (with working AI).
